## CodeMenu API
This section contains documentation for CodeMenu HTTP API. 

## Access
To be able to access this API, a user must first enable it in CodeMenu settings. Once its done, the server will be by default available at http://127.0.0.1:1300/v1/. 1300 is the default port, but the user can change it (this documentation assumes that the port is 1300). The user can also enable key protection, which means that your app must provide a user-specified key to access the API.
